**Measures of Descriptive Statistics:**

    Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the features of a dataset.
    Common measures include:
    Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
    Dispersion: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
    Shape: Skewness, Kurtosis
    These measures provide insights into the distribution and characteristics of the data.
  
**Probability and Probability Distribution:**

    Probability theory deals with the likelihood of events occurring.
    Basic concepts include:
    Sample space, events, and outcomes
    Probability axioms and rules (addition, multiplication)
    Probability distributions describe the likelihood of each outcome in a sample space.
    Common probability distributions include:
    Discrete Distributions: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson
    Continuous Distributions: Normal (Gaussian), Exponential, Uniform


**Estimation:**

      Estimation involves inferring population parameters from sample data.
      Point estimation aims to estimate a single value (e.g., population mean, proportion).
      Interval estimation provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to lie, along with a level of confidence.

**Hypothesis Testing:**

      Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data.
      The process involves:
          Formulating null and alternative hypotheses
          Selecting an appropriate test statistic and significance level (alpha)
          Calculating the p-value
          Drawing conclusions based on the p-value and comparing it to the significance level
      Common hypothesis tests include:
          Z-test and t-test for means
          Chi-square test for independence
